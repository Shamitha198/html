        <h2>History of Dhanushkodi</h2>
        <p>
         The place derives its name from the words "dhanush" (bow) and "kodi" (end). Legend has it that Lord Rama built a bridge, known as Ram Setu or Adam's Bridge, to Sri Lanka from here by using a bow. The town's sacred significance brings pilgrims from across the country to Dhanushkodi.

      <p>
        The best time of the day to visit Dhanushkodi is 6'oclock in the morning. A smooth and straight road flanked by two beautiful oceans run from Rameswaram to Dhanushkodi. The 30 min journey is most enjoyable. When you reach the farthest tip of Indian soil closest to Sri Lanka, one get to see the lapping of Bay of Bengal with its characteristic calmness as compared to the roaring Indian Ocean with bluish green waves.
        Since there is no man made structure for the visitors it is strongly advised to visit during early morning or late afternoon to avoid the scorching sun.
        It is also strongly recommended to keep the beach clean and not to take a dip because of unpredictable and interfering ocean currents.
        There are no coast guards to alert the visitors.
